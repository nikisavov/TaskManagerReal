After we run the program, we see the Task Manager System. You have 4 options- Add Task, Mark Task as Completed, View All Tasks and Exit. 
Add Task- it's a string, so write any task you want to do and the due date for it( due date can be in any format, it's a string as well)
Mark Task as Completed- will ask you to enter ID of the task completed. The ID of the task is determined by the order in which you put the task into the system. If it's the 1st task written down- ID is 1; if it's the 2nd task written down- ID is 2; etc.
View all tasks- will show you name of task, the due date and whether it's completed or not (boolean, so completion will be shown as "true" or "false")
Exit- exit the program
